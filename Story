Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a mango tree on the banks of a river. In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife. One day, the crocodile came to the bank and rested under the tree. Then the monkey offered him some fruits.The crocodile came back the next day, and the monkey and the crocodile became best friends.
